This project was developed for CS147 IoT Software and Systems at UCI. Our proposed project was to develop an IoT device that would serve as a garden monitoring system. Our device will be capable of tracking four important metrics that impact the lifespan of a plant: temperature, humidity, sunlight, and watering. Not only will our device track this data, but through a Wi-Fi access point it'll be able to send data to our web server hosted on Amazon Web Services(AWS). The data will be relayed to a user through a mobile application to allow easier readibility.
